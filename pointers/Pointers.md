# Pointers

Pointers are a powerful feature in C and C++ that allow you to directly access and manipulate memory. Understanding pointers is crucial for effective programming in C++.

## Contents

- **BasicPointers.cpp**: Introduces the concept of pointers and how to use them.
- **PointerArithmetic.cpp**: Demonstrates pointer arithmetic and how it works.
- **FunctionPointers.cpp**: Shows how to use function pointers to call functions dynamically.

### Getting Started

To run these examples, use a C++ compiler like `g++` and follow the provided instructions in each file. Understanding pointers will give you greater control over memory management and data structures in your programs.

## Example Programs

1. **BasicPointers.cpp**
2. **PointerArithmetic.cpp**
3. **FunctionPointers.cpp**
