# Classes

Classes are a fundamental part of C++ and allow you to create user-defined types. They are essential for implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Contents

- **SimpleClass.cpp**: Demonstrates a basic class with attributes and methods.
- **InheritanceExample.cpp**: Shows how to implement inheritance in C++.
- **PolymorphismExample.cpp**: Illustrates polymorphism through virtual functions.

### Getting Started

To run these examples, use a C++ compiler like `g++` and follow the provided instructions in each file. Understanding classes will enable you to design and implement complex systems effectively.

## Example Programs

1. **SimpleClass.cpp**
2. **InheritanceExample.cpp**
3. **PolymorphismExample.cpp**
